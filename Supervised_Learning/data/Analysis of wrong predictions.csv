Nick Lampson called and asked for a contribution. I committed to one without knowing about his vote on PNTR. I will keep my word by making an individual contribution but will also communicate to him that in my capacity as Enron PAC chair i cannot authorize the PAC to make a contribution as a result of that vote.

"In anticipation of potential litigation involving TW's operational activities, please prepare an analysis for me of the reasons for TW's sale of excess natural gas at the California border. I am aware of several of these sales and have been informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic reason for them. I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the following information: 1. What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border? 2. What is the process that is followed to make such a determination? 3. Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an operational sale is necessary? 4. In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to previous years? 5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision to make a sale is reached? Thanks for your attention to this request. Please give me a call to discuss and please designate your response as ""Privileged and Confidential, Attorney Client Privileged.""",0,1,"Words like 'discuss', 'draft', 'confirm', 'advice' are very common in category 1."

I would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first paragraph with ""and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at strategies for reducing CO2 emissions more broadly, in ways that make economic and environmental sense"" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol directly. And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and communicate their thoughts.

Sorry to re-write so much -- but I believe this is consistent with Steve's conversation with Ken, and with the media interviews he has given to date, as well as our advocacy on multipollutant and climate change.

Comments welcome ""The President, after a good deal of study and soul searching, decided not to support mandatory controls on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants as part of a multipollutant clean air strategy. His decision was based on some very important factors -- the nation's energy markets are experiencing unprecedented supply and price challenges that any CO2 mandate could exacerbate; and U.S. regulation of CO2 in the near-term could be ill-advised because the Kyoto protocol on global treatment of greenhouse gas emissions is unworkable in its current form. ""I was somewhat concerned that the message sent by the Bush administration would polarize the debate over how the U.S. should treat CO2 emissions in the long term, as his statement did provoke a very negative ""anti-environment"" reaction by many concerned individuals and organizations. Because this is an important issue to all parties on all sides of the debate, I believe that the administration should convene an ongoing process to carefully examine global climate change and all the long-term economic, scientific, and social impacts of action regulate CO2 emissions."" ""The President's position on CO2 notwithstanding, Enron continue to be a private sector leader in offering real solutions towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a rapidly expanding energy market. We are well-positioned through our experience with low-carbon fuels for electric generation (natural gas and wind in particular), our focus on new power generation and tecnologies, our leadership position in promoting efficiency through Enron Energy Services' energy outsourcing business, and our expertise in emissions trading and risk management."" ""A multipollutant appraoch to reducing power plant emissions makes a lot of sense from and environmental and energy policy standpoint. Enron will continue to work with the Bush administration and Congress toward structuring a program that can achieve environmental goals while providing incentives to build cleaner, more efficient generation, promoting a broad mix of fuels and tecnologies, and giving industry the flexibility and economic incentives to make reductions in a market-based, cost-effective way. If we're able to make meaningful reductions in 3 pollutants -- NOx, SO2 and mercury -- and we do it in a way that promotes efficiency and new technology, we'll make progress on CO2 whether it is regulated or not."" In the meantime, I will remain active in the global climate change debate to position Enron as a constructive player in the public policy arena and as an industry leader in promoting market-driven solutions to the world's energy and environmental problems. ----- Forwarded by Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron on 03/22/2001 05:55 PM ----- Rosalee Fleming 03/22/2001 11:16 AM To: Rob Bradley/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Tori L Wells/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: eBiz Story Rob, will you please draft a quote for Ken on these issues. ---------------------- Forwarded by Rosalee Fleming/Corp/Enron on 03/22/2001 11:06 AM --------------------------- Ann M Schmidt 03/22/2001 11:04 AM To: Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: eBiz Story Hi Mr. Lay, I am a Specialist in Corp. PR, under Karen Denne, and write for our internal eBiz publication. I am working on a story about the recent issue with respect to carbon dioxide emissions and Enron's position compared to President Bush's as well as the coal industry. I know that Bush's viewpoint on this issue is not to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants. I also understand he based his decision in large part due to a recent Department of Energy report that warns that such a policy would lead to an even more dramatic shift from coal to natural gas for electric power generation and significantly higher electricity prices causing problems similar to California. I wondered if you would mind adding first hand knowledge for employees. A quote from you about this issue would be great. I would also be interested in giving employees some of your reasons for being in favor of controlling CO2 such as your idea for a credit trading system for CO2. Thank you for your time and please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks, Ann Schmidt (x54694)",1,0,The email contains quoted text.

"Linda - as we discussed, adding a sentence on open access is key. Also, I would delete the sentence about the transmission system not being designed for the way it's being used today.

Thanks. Linda Robertson 03/30/2001 12:31 PM To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Palmer/Corp/Enron@ENRON cc: Subject: White House Talking Points and Abraham Mtg with EPSA 1. I am faxing to you a bootleg copy of the draft talking points Ed received this morning at the White House energy ""messaging"" meeting. These are very close hold. Ed asked that we not circulate these to anyone. Ed asked us to give him feedback of any concerns we have with the talking points (he will be giving them comments). After glancing at the TPs, the obvious missing point is open access. However, I am not sure we should be alarmed about that. There really isn't any policy in the TPs. This is a typical WH message document. Let me know if you think it is imperative to insert open access. Also, Ed would like to position us as the coalition leader of the White House outreach effort. Any thoughts? 2. I am faxing to you EPSA's summary of the generators meeting with Secretary Abraham. I am glad I did not attend this meeting. As you will see from the summary, there were three parts to the meeting: a) an exchange of policy views, both long and short term, b) discussion of how to maximize generator output in Calif; and c) a request that industry participate in a DOE reliability group. I don't see any follow up for Enron, outside of our normal course of activities and independent interchange with DOE officials. Let me know if you have additional thoughts.",1,0,The language is more suggestive than directive. Most category 1 emails are more directive.
