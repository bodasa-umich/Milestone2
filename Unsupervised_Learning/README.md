# Unsupervised Learning

This folder contains the Unsupervised Learning portion of the project. It focuses on various techniques to uncover hidden patterns in the data without using labeled responses. We explore clustering, dimensionality reduction, and other unsupervised learning methods on the SEC Complaint documents dataset.

The `unsupervised_learning.ipynb` notebook contains all the exploratory work and method selection process.
