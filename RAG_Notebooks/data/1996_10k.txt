                                     PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

NOTE: Enron Oregon Corp. (the "Company" or "New Enron") was incorporated under 
the laws of the State of Oregon on July 19, 1996 as a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Enron Corp. ("Enron"). The Company was formed solely for the purpose of 
effecting the transactions contemplated by the Amended and Restated Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of July 20, 1996 and amended and restated as of 
September 24, 1996 (the "Merger Agreement") among Enron, the Company and 
Portland General Corporation, an Oregon corporation ("PGC").

         Under the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, (i) Enron will be reincorporated as an Oregon corporation by merging
with and into New Enron (the "Reincorporation Merger") and (ii) immediately
thereafter, PGC will merge with and into New Enron, with New Enron being the
surviving corporation (the "PGC Merger" and, together with the Reincorporation
Merger, the "Mergers"). The Merger Agreement provides that if certain regulatory
reforms are enacted, the structure of the transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement will be revised to eliminate the Reincorporation Merger.

         On November 12, 1996, the respective stockholders of Enron and PGC
voted to adopt and approve the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement. Completion of the Mergers remains subject to satisfaction of
regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, including approval
by the Oregon Public Utilities Commission.

         As a result, New Enron has not issued any of its authorized shares,
except for 1,000 shares of Common Stock issued to Enron in connection with the
formation of New Enron. Furthermore, New Enron has no assets, liabilities or
equity as of December 31, 1996 (or as of the date hereof), except for immaterial
amounts of cash contributed by Enron in connection with the formation of New
Enron. In addition, New Enron has conducted no operations and has incurred no
liabilities.

         ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE NO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR MANAGEMENT'S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THIS
REPORT.

         Upon the consummation of the Mergers, the assets, liabilities and
equity of Enron and PGC will become assets, liabilities and equity of New Enron
and will be included in New Enron's financial statements.
